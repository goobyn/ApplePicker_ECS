### Other Implementation Notes

This is a full rework of the original Apple Picker project, done with OOP (https://github.com/goobyn/applepicker).

The score tracker functionality is currently the only thing missing from the ECS version.

GitHub also did not like how large the project files are, so only the "Scripts" folder of the project will be uploaded here.
